            <h1>THIS WEEK AT BUNGIE - 15/07/2021</h1>
            <small>Jul 15, 2021 - dmg04</small>
        </section>

        <p>
            This week at Bungie, we talk rituals and reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Week two of Solstice of Heroes began. Between celebrating your accomplishments over the last year and a return of sunlight to the Last City, things are feeling pretty good. Make sure to pack some sunscreen on your way to the EAZ. Wouldn’t want you to get sunburnt. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We have six weeks until a new Season. There are many of us who have an insatiable appetite for content, but there’s always going to be some time to relax during the Seasons of Destiny. Gives folks time to catch up, or just take a breather from our fight against the Darkness. We think it’s about time we start trickling out some fun details. A few little snacks here and there, or a few bite-sized treats to enjoy if you aren’t still chewing on a Season full of Overrides, Expunges, and more. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This week, our Season 15 appetizers come in the form of ritual reputation updates.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>EARNING A REPUTATION</h2>

        <p>
            The steady climb towards rewards and reputation is something I’ve come to love in Destiny 2 over the last few Seasons. Sometimes a reset can fly by when playing with a group of friends, but other times, I could get stuck trying to finish out my Gambit challenges. Even so, having a direct way to grind out some Ascendant Shards was a welcome change with the release of Beyond Light. This week, Rituals Lead Alan Blaine will be walking us through some great changes that the team has been working on to unify the reputation experiences of our ritual activities. As a warning, we are going to be diving a little deeper into the details here. If you’re a Destiny 2 Novice, don’t be afraid to ask questions. We’ll be more than happy to answer what we can after this TWAB is live! 
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            <b>Alan: </b>Hey Guardians! Season 15 will bring the next steps of our ritual unification that started all the way back in Season 13.
        </p>

        <p class="i-1"><b>Unifying Ritual Ranks and Reputation</b></p>

        <p class="i-1">
            Over the last few Seasons, we’ve been looking to create a unified experience when playing ritual activities in Destiny 2. Starting with Crucible and Gambit, we created new vendor reputation systems and reward tracks. We did some backend work at the start of Season 14 in preparation for larger-scale changes to these reputations, while also preparing for the introduction of Vanguard Ranks.
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img class="i-1 main-img" src="/assets/Rituals.jpg" alt="rituals">
        </div>

        <p class="i-1">Before we dive deeper on Vanguard Ranks, let’s talk a little bit about the updates to reputation systems overall as we prepare for a future where more vendors are given similar treatment. </p>

        <div class="list-margin">
            <li class="i-2">In Season 15, ritual reputation systems on Lord Shaxx, The Drifter, and Commander Zavala will be known as Crucible, Gambit, and Vanguard Ranks.</li>
    
            <li class="i-3">The names Infamy and Valor will be retired.</li>

            <li class="i-4">Glory will continue to live as our competitive Crucible reputation system.</li>
        
            <li class="i-3">We are also introducing Trials Ranks in Season 15 -- more about that in a future TWAB.</li>
        
            <li class="i-2">We’re rebalancing all ranking systems to have similar progression times.</li>

            <li class="i-3">Our goal is to let players reset Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit Ranks slightly faster, on average, than Valor currently allows.</li>

            <li class="i-3">There will no longer be ritual-specific rules that impede progress.</li>

            <li class="i-3">We are removing win streak bonuses, in exchange for activity streak bonuses.</li>

            <li class="i-3">Reputation bonus weeks have been standardized to 2x multipliers when active.</li>

            <li class="i-3">Bounties will no longer provide reputations as rewards, but primarily focus on XP.</li>

        </div>

        <p class="i-1">
            We looked at how long it would take for players who win nearly every game to reset their reputation versus players who lose nearly every game and tuned it so that the total time taken to reset is only around 2x, rather than the 3-4x right now. Overall, we expect two-thirds of your reputation come from simply playing activities. If you win matches in Crucible or Gambit, you’ll still reset a bit faster. 
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">As we mentioned, Glory will continue to live as our competitive Crucible reputation system and will also retain win-streaks for faster ranking. We don’t have any specific plans to share on Glory right now, but we will be looking at opportunities in future Seasons for potential updates.</p>

        <p class="i-1"><b>Vanguard Ranks</b></p>

        <p class="i-1">Commander Zavala is getting a full ritual reputation, like Lord Shaxx and the Drifter before him. As a note, Vanguard Tokens are being retired, so make sure to spend them before Season 15 begins.</p>

        <p class="i-1">Players may earn Vanguard reputation when completing the following activities:</p>

        <div class="list-no-margin">
            <li class="i-2">Strikes</li>
            <li class="i-2">Nightfalls</li>
            <li class="i-2">Battlegrounds</li>
        </div>
        
        <p class="i-1">For those looking to take on a challenge, Nightfalls give different bonuses based on completion medals, which can be earned through high scores and defeating all Champions. Bronze, silver, gold, and platinum medals grant reputation bonuses, and Nightfalls grant reputation multipliers depending on the difficulty of Nightfall selected. The more difficult the Nightfall, the higher the multiplier will be!</p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img class="i-1 main-img" src="/assets/Rewards.jpg" alt="rewards">
        </div>

        <p class="i-1">Zavala will also have a full reputation reward line, similar to the ones we added for Shaxx and Drifter in Season 13. Powerful rewards will be granted every third rank, and an Ascendant Shard will be rewarded when resetting the first time.</p>

        <p class="i-1"><b>Activity Streaks and Reputation Bonuses</b></p>

        <p class="i-1">As noted above, Season 15 will introduce activity streaks. The longer you stay in Vanguard activities (playlists or direct launch), the larger your streak bonus is. Guardians can leave the matchmaking queue to snag bounties from the Tower or clean out their Postmaster in the H.E.L.M. without worry of losing their activity streaks. As a note, quitting activities or going AFK for extended periods of time will invalidate your streak, so be ready to play if you’re looking to keep yours going.</p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img class="i-1 main-img" src="/assets/Strike_Bosses.jpg" alt="strike bosses">
        </div>

        <p class="i-1">As with Crucible and Gambit, Zavala will be looking to host weeklong reputation bonuses throughout a given Season. Stay tuned for in-game announcements.</p>

        <p class="i-1"><b>Seasonal Ritual Weapon Quest and Ornaments</b></p>

        <p class="i-1">Next Season, we are moving the seasonal ritual weapon and ornaments to the reputation reward tracks of Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit. As players increase their reputation during the Season, they’ll work towards unlocking the weapon and respective ornaments from each vendor. We’re also opting to update Seasonal Challenges, removing things like “In it for Infamy” in favor of challenges to earn ritual weapon rewards.</p>

        <p class="i-1"><b>Grandmasters and Conqueror Gilding</b></p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img class="i-1 main-img" src="/assets/Nightfall_The-Ordeal_Banner.jpg" alt="nightfall banner">
        </div>

        <p class="i-1">Back when we introduced Grandmaster Nightfalls and the Conqueror title, with gilding Seals still nine months away, we wanted to give players a hard-to-reach goal that measured both skill, communication, build-crafting, and time commitment, but that was also mindful of player’s time and real-life schedules. We saw a lot of feedback about rewards and general time commitments to reach Grandmaster levels, so we’ve been making some improvements Season over Season.</p>

        <div class="list-margin">

            <li class="i-2">We added better Masterworking material drops, Adept weapons and mods, and title gilding.</li>

            <li class="i-2">Seasonal Challenges and +10 Power Seasons means it has never been easier to get to the Pinnacle and Artifact Power needed early in the Season.</li>

            <li class="i-2">The addition of a catch-up node, which currently appears during the final three weeks of a given season, helped many players conquer this aspirational content, even if they couldn’t play every week of a given Season.</li>

        </div>

        <p class="i-1">Thanks to these changes, we’re seeing a lot more players attempting Grandmasters and gilding their Conqueror titles than ever before. While we still believe that starting in week-seven gives GMs a nice Seasonal cadence, waiting until the final three weeks of the Season to gild no longer feels correct. We would like players to play the week’s Grandmaster Nightfall for rewards, not Lake of Shadows the easiest perceived strike.</p>

        <p class="i-1">Later in Season 15, we're planning to make the following changes to the Grandmaster catch-up node to let players gild their title earlier in the Season, while also addressing our concerns over a single strike being a boon for high-tier rewards over the last three weeks of a Season:</p>

        <div class="list-margin">

            <li class="i-2">The Grandmaster catch-up node will become available at the same time that Grandmaster difficulty is available, so long as you have the Conqueror title but have not yet gilded it this Season.</li>

            <li class="i-2">Each Grandmaster Nightfall will be available if the fireteam leader has not completed the gilding Triumph for that strike during the Season.</li>

            <li class="i-3">In other words, you may play each featured strike for a Season to earn your gilded title.</li>

            <li class="i-3">Once you’ve gilded your title, the catch-up node will no longer be available.</li>
            
        </div>

        <p class="i-1">We’re excited to release these changes in Season 15 and are looking forward to your feedback. Once you’ve had some time to dig in and earn your rewards, sound off with your thoughts!</p>
